# name: Measure Length

Draw a line to measure the length.

# container: Tools

# waring-webmercator: 

Warning: 
The coordinate system for calculating the measurements is WebMercator. 
Due to the length distortions in this map projection, the values deviate 
significantly from reality!

# length-m: Length (m)

# 3d:

## determine-3d-length: Determine 3D Length

## length: 3D Length (total)
## elevation-difference: Elevation Difference (total)
## segment-horizontal-distance: Segment: Horizontal Distance
## segment-3d-distance: Segment: 3D Distance
## segment-inclination-angle: Segment: Inclination Angle
## segment-azimuth: Segment: Azimuth

## exception-no-results: Height query does not return results
## exception-invalid-elevation: No valid elevation value
## exception-no-valid-results: Height cannot be determined for all points. 3D measuring not possible
