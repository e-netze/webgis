clip:				Clip
clipObjects:		Clip Objects
clipDescription:    Draw a polygon on the map to use as the clipping area.

ClipIntersectedAndDifference:		Intersection + Difference
ClipIntersected:					Intersection
ClipDifference:					    Difference
ClipXor:							Symmetric Difference

DrawClipPolygonFirst:               Please draw a clipping area first.

ApplyClipToIntersected:			Apply only to intersected objects
ApplyClipToIntersected-description:
                                If multiple objects are selected and not all of them are intersected by the clipping
                                area, only the intersected objects will be affected by the clipping. The other objects
                                will remain unchanged.
ApplyClipToAll:					Apply to all objects
ApplyClipToAll-description:    
                                If multiple objects are selected and not all of them are intersected by the clipping
                                area, all objects will be affected by the clipping, including those outside the clipping
                                area, which will be included in the difference layer (optional). If only the intersection
                                layer is selected as a result, all objects in the difference layer will be deleted.
                                
DisolveMultipartFeatures:		Dissolve multipart features
DisolveMultipartFeatures-description:
                                If an object is divided into several parts by clipping, a new object is created from each
                                part. This prevents multipart features from being created. Clipping can create more objects
                                than were originally selected.
                                
ClippedFeaturesStayMultiparts:	Clipped features as multiparts
ClippedFeaturesStayMultiparts-description:
                                If an object is divided into several parts by clipping, it remains as one object that consists
                                of multiple parts. In this case, a multipart feature is created. After clipping, there will be
                                the same number of objects as before clipping.
